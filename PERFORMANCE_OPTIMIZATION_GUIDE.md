# Performance Optimization Guide

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Three.js Scene Optimization

- **Reduced star count**: From 1000 to 200 stars
- **Reduced particle count**: From 100 to 30 particles
- **Simplified lighting**: Removed spot light, reduced intensity
- **Added damping**: Better performance with OrbitControls damping
- **Reduced animation complexity**: Slower auto-rotation speed

### 2. Animation Optimization

- **Reduced background elements**: From 4 to 2 animated elements
- **Simplified floating icons**: From 4 to 2 icons with simpler animations
- **Reduced animation complexity**: Fewer simultaneous animations
- **Optimized transition durations**: Longer, smoother transitions

### 3. Image Optimization

- **Added WebP/AVIF support**: Modern image formats for better compression
- **Optimized image sizes**: Reduced device sizes array
- **Added quality settings**: 75% quality for better performance
- **Proper lazy loading**: Images load only when needed

### 4. Bundle Size Optimization

- **Better code splitting**: Improved dynamic imports
- **Error boundaries**: Prevent crashes from affecting performance
- **Lightweight performance monitoring**: Reduced monitoring overhead
- **Optimized webpack config**: Better chunk splitting

### 5. Performance Monitoring

- **Error boundaries**: Catch and handle errors gracefully
- **Lightweight monitoring**: Only critical metrics tracked
- **Performance observers**: Monitor long tasks and layout shifts
- **Memory monitoring**: Track memory usage

## Additional Recommendations

### 1. Image Optimization

Run the image optimization script:

```bash
npm run optimize-images
```

### 2. Bundle Analysis

Analyze your bundle size:

```bash
npm run analyze
```

### 3. Performance Testing

Test with various tools:

```bash
npm run lighthouse
npm run pagespeed
```

### 4. Further Optimizations

#### A. Consider removing heavy dependencies:

- PDF viewer (if not essential)
- Some Three.js features
- Unused animation libraries

#### B. Implement service worker for caching:

```javascript
// Add to next.config.js
const withPWA = require('next-pwa')({
  dest: 'public',
  register: true,
  skipWaiting: true,
})
```

#### C. Use CDN for static assets:

- Move images to a CDN
- Use optimized image delivery

#### D. Implement critical CSS:

- Extract critical CSS for above-the-fold content
- Defer non-critical CSS

### 5. Monitoring and Maintenance

#### A. Regular performance audits:

- Weekly Lighthouse tests
- Monitor Core Web Vitals
- Check bundle size changes

#### B. Performance budgets:

- Set limits for bundle size
- Monitor image sizes
- Track loading times

#### C. User experience monitoring:

- Track real user metrics
- Monitor error rates
- Check mobile performance

## Expected Results

After these optimizations, you should see:

- **Faster initial load**: Reduced bundle size and optimized images
- **Better Core Web Vitals**: Improved LCP, FID, and CLS scores
- **Reduced timeout errors**: Less heavy processing on initial load
- **Better mobile performance**: Optimized for slower connections
- **Improved user experience**: Smoother animations and interactions

## Testing Your Optimizations

1. **Build and test locally**:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run start
   ```

2. **Test with Google PageSpeed Insights**:
   - Visit your deployed site
   - Run PageSpeed test
   - Check for timeout errors

3. **Monitor performance metrics**:
   - Use browser dev tools
   - Check Network tab for load times
   - Monitor Memory usage

4. **Test on different devices**:
   - Mobile devices
   - Slower connections
   - Different browsers

## Troubleshooting

If you still experience timeout errors:

1. **Check server response time**: Ensure your hosting provider is fast
2. **Reduce initial bundle further**: Consider removing more features
3. **Implement progressive loading**: Load features as needed
4. **Use static generation**: Pre-render pages where possible
5. **Optimize server-side rendering**: Reduce SSR complexity

## Next Steps

1. Deploy the optimized version
2. Test with Google PageSpeed Insights
3. Monitor real user metrics
4. Iterate based on results
5. Continue optimizing based on user feedback
