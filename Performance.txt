1. Reduce Render-Blocking Resources

 Inline critical CSS or load CSS asynchronously.
Check /_next/static/css/085c6891b0bd14c88.css – it blocks rendering.

 Defer or async non-critical JavaScript (large _next/static/chunks/... files).

 Use code splitting to avoid bundling unused JS on first load.

2. Optimize Images

 Serve modern formats (WebP/AVIF) instead of JPEG/PNG where possible.

 Ensure images include width and height to prevent layout shifts.

 Use responsive srcset and lazy-loading for below-the-fold images.

 Convert static images into Next.js Image component (with priority for LCP image).

3. Improve Font Loading

 Add font-display: swap to all custom fonts (Inter, Poppins, Noto Sans Arabic).

 Consider using next/font instead of external font loading.

4. Reduce Final DOM Size

 Current final HTML is +185 KB (88% larger) than delivered HTML.

 Move toward server-side rendering (SSR) or static site generation (SSG) where possible.

 Pre-render more critical HTML instead of relying on client-side JavaScript hydration.

5. Improve Caching & Requests

 Set proper cache headers for static assets.
Two files have inadequate cache (helvetiker_regular.typeface.json, drei-assets/...hdr).

 Fix the HTTP redirect from githack.com → use a stable CDN or self-host.

6. Accessibility Fixes

 Add alt text or aria-label to <svg> elements flagged without accessibility attributes.

7. Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)

 Current LCP is ~6.9s (too high).

 Optimize hero image: preload it, compress it, and set priority in Next.js <Image>.

 Avoid unnecessary animations or transformations that delay rendering.

8. General Performance

 Enable Brotli/Gzip compression (already partially in use, ensure all assets compressed).

 Use Next.js next/script with strategy="lazyOnload" for analytics/third-party scripts.

 Reduce long tasks: main thread blocked for 1188ms by heavy JS bundles – consider splitting or reducing dependencies.
